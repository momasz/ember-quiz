Ember Quizmaker
==========

This is a CMS for building Buzzfeed-style quizzes. It runs on Heroku with Ember.js and MongoDB, and originally used the Yeoman Ember generator.

It makes quizzes like these:

### Note:
This git repo was created from an existing project which had a private repo. We removed some stuff to make it easier to make it public.
